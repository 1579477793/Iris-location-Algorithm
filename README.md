# Iris-location-Algorithm
A method of gray value of unit sector area is proposed to solve the problem of iris localization.First, in this method, a rectangular area containing pupil is segmented by gray-scale projection algorithm, meanwhile,the OTSU algorithm is used to determine the threshold of this rectangular area and segment the pupil. With respect to outer location in a certain direction, a sector area in the direction needs to be segmented according to the pupil center. Then the gray value of each concentric sector ring is calculated by setting steps to 5 pixels,and the abscissa values of the position where the maximum change in gray value is calculated as the radius in that direction.The location of boundary points in other directions is also applied by this method.Finally, these points are filtered and used to fit outer boundary of iris. The results shows that the iris image segmented by this method can achieve good result with good application and reference value.
